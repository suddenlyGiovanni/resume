# @suddenlygiovanni/schema-resume

## 14.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4e37237: Refactored project into a monorepo, decoupling resume data from the schema and improving project
  structure. This involved updating build processes, linting, formatting, and configuration files. The
  resume is now a separate package and build process now publishes only the schema package.
