  summary: |
    I am a Software Developer, a geek, and, more generally, a problem solver in the continuous pursuit of meaning.
    I am also a young father of three and a devoted husband. My transition from the social sciences to software engineering has enhanced my innate curiosity, pragmatic approach, and desire to find new ways to solve old problems.
    I’m looking to work in an environment where I can continuously grow as a developer, where experimentation is encouraged, failure is the tool to shape a better understanding of the given domain, and my efforts add up to something truly useful.
