## 11.2.0

### Minor Changes

- dfecf31: Upgrade `@effect/schema` dependency to v0.67.0

  ## Summary

  The changes mostly pertained to the use of the `@effect/schema` library. The actions ranged from
  updates and clarifications in `@effect/schema` type annotations, simplifications of `@effect/schema`
  import statements, the removal of unused imports from `@effect/schema`, and an update in supported
  versions of the `@effect/schema` peer dependency.

  ## Changes

  - The supported versions for the `@effect/schema` peer dependency in `package.json` was updated,
    with only version "~0.67.0" now supported.
  - This might restrict the use of the library along with other libraries or projects that require
    different versions of `@effect/schema`. It is recommended to check any project that uses this
    library for compatibility.

  - Import statements across the `schema-resume` module have been simplified by directly
    importing `JSONSchema` and `Schema` from `@effect/schema`.
  - These changes should make the import statements cleaner and more straightforward, enhancing code
    readability and maintainability.

  - Type and method imports in test files have been restructured, and now those entities are directly
    imported from `@effect/schema`.
  - This improvement in the structure of the import statements should make the test files easier to
    read and maintain.

  ## Impact

  The new changes should not cause any major breaking changes. Yet, it is crucial that all tests are
  executed to assure that the newest changes to `@effect/schema` haven't inadvertently introduced any
  issues. Affected areas should be thoroughly tested, given the changes to `@effect/schema` import
  structuring, type annotations, and peer dependency versioning.

### Patch Changes

## 11.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 3d8551d: Configuration Update:
  The baseUrl and paths settings in the TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) have been
  deactivated (commented out) to default TypeScript's module resolution strategy back to its default,
  and to avoid any conflicts with other module resolution settings in the project.

  Import Refactoring:
  Absolute imports in the src directory have been replaced with relative imports in an effort to
  prevent import issues and enhance code modularity.
  Additionally, this refactoring aims to improve the overall consistency of the project.
